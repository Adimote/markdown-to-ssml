# Markdown to SSML converter

This is a **super simple** script to generate SSML from markdown.

## Installation

just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

## Running

When you run the script, it reads STDin to it's end, then prints the output to STDout.

An example usage would be to run `python convert.py < README.md`
